# Minehut Suggestions [EXAMPLE]

Welcome to the Minehut Suggestions tracker. Here you can submit your ideas of potential features Minehut should implement to our network and collaborate with other users who have suggested their own.

### Submitting a Suggestion

***Note before suggesting:*** *Please make sure your suggestion has not already been submitted and is not a bug.*

1. To suggest your own feature, open a thread [here](https://github.com/minehutmc/suggestions/issues/new). 
2. For the title, describe your suggestion in a single sentence or phrase (e.g. add two-factor authentication to the panel). 
3. If necessary, explain your suggestion in more detail in the description. Feel free to add resources like images, videos, and links to elaborate.
4. Submit your suggestion to the world!

### Voting on other Suggestions

Votes are an objective way to see if users like or dislike a suggestion.

**To upvote an idea,** simply add the 👍 reaction to the original message. 
**To downvote an idea,** add the 👎 reaction to the message. 

This way developers can see at a glance which suggestions are most favored in the community.

### Do:

* Search the tracker to ensure that your idea is not a duplicate
* Be clear and concise in your title & description
* Take advantage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) -- it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better!
* Create a unique thread for each suggestion

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add comments such as 👍, +1 or "I like this idea" *(instead upvote or downvote using reactions)*
* Submit issues that are general suggestions as opposed to specific ideas
* Create disrespectful or inflammatory comments

**Please note: This is not the place to report bugs or issues. Your ticket will be deleted and you will be redirected.**
